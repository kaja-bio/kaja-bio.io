Another woman (Madge) comes from behind him, clapping each time he steps. She looks miserable. He places down the plate when he reaches the table.

Cleaner jumps up and starts wiping nothing off the counters, mopping, etc.. Ivan goes and takes a chopping board and starts to chop nothing. Madge goes to a register.

She walks around the stage while talking, showing around the Burger King and the people there with her)</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;It&rsquo;s been a couple years now that I&rsquo;ve lived in this Burger King. You&rsquo;d think it&rsquo;d be a pretty miserable place to be, but it&rsquo;s actually sort of nice. The chairs are comfortable. There&rsquo;s loads of food still in the pantry, even though the four of us have been eating for an eternity. And in this disturbing, strangling, eating-me-up and crushing me way, it feels like home. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3">(walking over to Aisha, adjusting her party hat) </span><span class="c0">Aisha and Ivan like it best, I think. Although sometimes I think they hate it and the only one of us who loves it is the Cleaner, because she doesn&rsquo;t seem to want to do anything but clean. She used to work at the pub down the road - I saw her down there, back before everything went to shit. Yknow. What with the apocalypse and all. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3">(She walks over to the cleaner) </span><span class="c0">You would think that survival is the hardest part of the apocalypse, but it&rsquo;s not. It&rsquo;s the lack of routine. All of those books you read, about people finding courage and purpose and Their Inner Selves among the rubble of the wasted world?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Bunch of horse shit.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">As soon as we were able to, what we yearned for most was to be cogs in the machine again. And so here we are. At the end of the day, it&rsquo;s not even the warmth or the food or the shelter that keep us here. It&rsquo;s the sense of place. We serve. We work together. We worship profit, even if money no longer exists. It&rsquo;s an old, dead god, but we serve him anyway. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3">(madge pauses) </span><span class="c0">But lately, I&rsquo;ve been wondering what&rsquo;s outside again.</span></p><p class="c2 c5"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4 c3">Alarm. Everyone unfreezes and goes back to doing what they were doing before. CLEANER walks around mopping the floors, humming to herself. AISHA walks around with a notebook and a pen, taking stock. IVAN continues chopping, cooking, etc. MADGE looks out at the audience, semi-frozen.</span></p><p class="c2 c5"><span class="c4 c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">AISHA</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Madge, if you&rsquo;re free right now, could you look over the broken till?</span></p><p class="c2 c5"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">MADGE</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">All of the tills are broken, Aisha. Everything here is broken. </span></p><p class="c2 c5"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">AISHA</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3">(forced smiling) </span><span class="c0">Madge, I&rsquo;d really appreciate not having this conversation with you right now.</span></p><p class="c2 c5"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">MADGE</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3">(sarcastically) </span><span class="c0">Yes chef.</span></p><p class="c2 c5"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4 c3">MADGE fiddles around with a terminal. CLEANER comes up around her and, while IVAN and AISHA are distracted, slips a piece of paper into her pocket. MADGE whips around to look at her, but CLEANER has gone back to mopping/sweeping/etc. MADGE takes the piece of paper out of her pocket, reads it, then slips it back into her pocket. </span></p><p class="c2 c5"><span class="c4 c3"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">INT. BURGER KING BATHROOM</span></p><p class="c2 c5"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4 c3">MADGE is by the sink, looking in the mirror. She looks tired. CLEANER comes into the room and MADGE turns to look at her.</span></p><p class="c2 c5"><span class="c4 c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">MADGE</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">What did you mean by the note? </span></p><p class="c2 c5"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4 c3">CLEANER shrugs.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">MADGE</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3">(reading the note) </span><span>&ldquo;Routine hides insanity.&rdquo; </span><span class="c3">(looking at CLEANER) </span><span class="c0">You know, it&rsquo;s the first time we&rsquo;ve ever spoken. Really spoken.</span></p><p class="c2 c5"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4 c3">CLEANER nods.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">MADGE</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">I mean, I know this counts, too. I know words aren&rsquo;t the only way to communicate. But I miss words. I miss sane words. I miss words that mean something, words that aren&rsquo;t a vehicle to convey the fact that we need to refill the Sprite. I miss poetry and theater. I miss the days that weren&rsquo;t predictable, that weren&rsquo;t routine, I miss getting to shirk tradition. </span></p><p class="c2 c5"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4 c3">CLEANER steps up to MADGE, who&rsquo;s still, throughout this whole thing, wearing her party hat. She gently takes off the party hat and tears off a piece, chews it up, spits it out, then offers the same to MADGE, who does the same. </span></p><p class="c2 c5"><span class="c4 c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">MADGE</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3">(spitting it out)</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;I&rsquo;m sorry I never learned your name.</span></p><p class="c2 c5"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4 c3">At that moment, IVAN and AISHA burst in.
